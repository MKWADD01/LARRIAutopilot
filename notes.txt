GOALS:
1.) Run the YOLO application simultaneously with app.py/flask application.
2.) Connect the detect.py object detection to Comma camera.

Notes:
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
^^^ documentation on how to run program

python detect.py --source 0
^^^ command to test out detect.py

Parse function provides parameters that can be used in command line.
The --source allows you to select a video feed, which we will replace with either the road camera or road camera wide.

This link is also in the discord if it doesn't work from here

I have added in yolov5 from a zip file rather than a clone since it seemed to be causing issues with pushing,
and now the files should be changeable without getting an error
